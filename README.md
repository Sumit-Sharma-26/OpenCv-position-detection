Welcome to the Video Position Detection project! This repository contains the code and resources for detecting and tracking positions within a video stream using Python and the OpenCV library.

## Overview

The Video Position Detection project focuses on utilizing computer vision techniques to identify and track positions within a video sequence. By leveraging OpenCV's capabilities, this application detects certain visual features or objects within each frame of a video and provides relevant position information.

## Features

- Position detection and tracking within video streams.
- Real-time position visualization.
- Customizable detection algorithms and parameters.
- Support for various video formats.

## Demo

Insert a GIF or link to a video that demonstrates your position detection in video application in action.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
